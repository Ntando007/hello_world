# hello_world
My first repository in Github.

Hi everyone, name is Ntando, I am on my journey to learn software engineering. A bit about me: I love being around family, adventure and spend time with my dogs.

My interests are working in data, as i am still a beginner i am willing to put in my time and learn.
